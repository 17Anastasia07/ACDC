    <div class="text">The video game says play me
<br>
      Face it, on a level, but it take you
      <br>
      Every time on a one on one
      <br>
      Feeling runnin' down your spine
      <br>
      Nothing gonna save your one last dime cause it owns you
      <br>
      Through and through
      <br>
      The data bank know my number
      <br>
      Says I gotta pay 'cause I made the grade last year
      <br>
      Feel it when I turn the screw
      <br>
      Kick you 'round the world
      <br>
      There ain't a thing that it can't do,
      <br>
Do to you - Yeah!
<br>
Who made who, who made you?
<br>
Who made who, ain't nobody told you?
<br>
Who made who, who made you?
<br>
If you made them and they made you Who picked up the bill, and who made who? - Yeah!
<br>
Who made who, who turned the screw?
<br>
Satellite send me pictures
<br>
Get it in the eye
<br>
Take it to the wire
<br>
Spinning like a dynamo
<br>
Feel it going round and round
<br>
Runnin' outta chips
<br>
You got no line in an eight bit town
<br>
So don't look down, no
<br>
Who made who, who made you?
<br>
Who made who, ain't nobody told you
<br>
Who made who, who made you?
<br>
If you made them and they made you
<br>
Who picked up the bill and who made who
<br>
Ain't nobody told you
<br>
Who made who
<br>
Who made you
<br>
Who made who
<br>
Who made who
<br>
Yeah
<br>
Nobody told you
